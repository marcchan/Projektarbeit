The author would like to thank Prof.~T.J.~Ellis and
Prof.~A.~Georgiadis for their supervision, encouragement and
valuable discussions. The author is also very grateful to
Dipl.-Ing.~J.~Mahalek who triggered this very interesting project
and to Dipl.-Ing.~L.~Eisenmann for fruitful discussions and
contributions in the development of systems for detecting
occupants and for his support at BMW.\\

I wish to thank Dr.~S-B.~Park for his introduction to CMOS cameras
and smart illumination and his tireless explanations. I will never
forget our in-circuit software development during high-speed test
drives. I also have to thank J.J.~Yoon for his support in multiple
mathematical problems and value discussions about illumination
strategies.

Special thanks to my fellows at BMW who helped me bring our
HDR-camera from illusions and raw ideas to reality: S.~Akisogulu,
W.~Solka, S.~Weidhaas and A.~Augst. I also express my gratitude to
the fellows who looked carefully through this manuscript and
helped to improve it with a number of corrections, suggestions and
good
questions.\\

Finally I want to thank my wonderful wife Melanie
for her constant faith, love and encouragement.\\
